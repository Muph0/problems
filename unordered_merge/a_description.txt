There are two stacks of cards letters 'A' ... 'Z'. You can only take from the
top of the stacks and place them face down on a single pile. You must take all
the cards and put them to the pile, you can only decide from which stact to
take, one card at a time.

Construct the pile in such way that when you take if from the table and flip it
face up, it is a lexicographically minimal pile from all the possible piles you
could have constructed.
